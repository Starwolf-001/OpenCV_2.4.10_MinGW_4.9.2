# OpenCV_2.4.10_MinGW_4.9.2
OpenCV version 2.4.10 with MinGW-64 version 4.9.2

=Briefing=
I have found over the years how many versions of OpenCV fail when trying to CMake a MinGW compiler version.

Many tutorials, both on web forums and YouTube, show how you can get OpenCV to work with Code::Blocks... and most of the time they will fail.

This repo contains OpenCV version 2.4.10 for CodeBlocks.

The tutorial for which MinGW version was and how to create this OpenCV can be found at the link below
